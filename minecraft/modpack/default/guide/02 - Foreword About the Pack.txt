This pack is intended to be used with Mo' Creatures but cannot redistribute it.  It is highly recommended that you install this mod as documented in the pack description.  Config files and spawning tables are provided as a part of this installation.  You will then need to navigate to your minecraft/scripts directory and rename Mo' Creatures.save to Mo' Creatures.zs and restart the game for the changes to take effect (yes, I know about "/mt reload" just trust me and restart the pack).

Chococraft is also a strogly recommened addition to this pack, but at this time I ave been unable to get into contact with the mod author in order to request permission.  The configuration files and spawn tables have been included so all you need to do is download it and drop it in the mods folder.  There are no scripts you need to activate for this one.
