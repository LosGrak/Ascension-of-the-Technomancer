This pack is intended to be used with Mo' Creatures but cannot redistribute it.  It is highly recommended that you install this mod as documented in the pack description.  Config files and spawning tables are provided as a part of this installation.  Once installed, you will then need to navigate to your ../minecraft/scripts directory and rename Mo' Creatures.save to Mo' Creatures.zs and restart the game for the changes to take effect (yes, I know about "/mt reload" just trust me and restart the client).

Chococraft is also a strongly recommened addition to this pack, but at this time I have been unable to get into contact with the mod author in order to request permission.  The configuration files and spawn tables have been included so all you need to do is download it and drop it in the mods folder.  There are no scripts you need to activate for this one.

One final and important thing to be aware of is that if you have already launched into a world with this modpack at least once before installing these additional mods, there will be some corruption of the included Just Another Spawner (JAS) configuration files for these mods post installation.  Specifically, you will get additional spawn table records of all creatures from the installed  mods added to all biomes spawn tables.  This is an artifact of how JAS creates it's default configuration files.  To compensate for this, I have included an additional copy the packs original spawn tables in ../minecraft/config/JustAnotherSpawnerRestore.  To preform the restoration, delete ../minecraft/config/JustAnotherSpawner and copy ../minecraft/config/JustAnotherSpawnerRestore back to ../minecraft/config/JustAnotherSpawner to replace the folders and files you deleted.  Always copy the restore folder into the original name.  Don't just perform a rename as you will loose the backup spawn tables I provided.
