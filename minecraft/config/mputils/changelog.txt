§bConfig ~ AR laser drill ore list was changed to a blacklist and emptied out, as all ores that spawn on a planet are eligible for laser drilling (because it's actually grabbing blocks from the planet surface)§r
§bConfig ~ Lots more ores available in geodes§r
§bConfig ~ Exposure to vacuum made extra deadly... for extra fun§r
§aAdded ~ Added redstone/electrotine asteroid and tinkered with probabilities/variability of asteroids§r

§aAdded ~ Added GT Vein Locator§r
§bConfig ~ Setting more Advanced Rocketry recipes§r
§bConfig ~ Rebuilt spawn tables by forcing an update of BiomeGroups.cfg to eliminate references to biomes that no longer exist, and also to cleanup the net.* name collision resolutions that built up over the development process§r

§cBugfix ~  ~ Fixed unification exploit with the AnyIron and AnyCopper oredict entries and JABBA barrels.  Also deactivated AnyCopper and AnyIron in AOBD and Technomancy pure ores§r

§1§l§nVersion 4.3.8§r§1§l
§cBugfix ~  ~ Disabled Baublelicious magic items because they have easy recipes.  This mod should still allow for Botania and Thaumcraft baubles to be consolidated using the entangling items.  If it doesn't then this mod will be pulled from the load out in a future release§r

§bConfig ~ Added a special thanks section for users who have helped with bug tracking to the introduction page of the FTBUtils guide§r

§1§l§nVersion 4.3.5§r§1§l
§bConfig ~ Sort out changes to spawn tables after deactivating BoP biome overrides§r
§bConfig ~ Updated ThaumicExploration§r
§cBugfix ~ Back dates ThaumicNEI to prevent last TC recipe accessed from "sticking" in the NEI recipes array in memory and appearing inappropriately in subsequent lookups§r
§bConfig ~ Back ported InPureCore from 5.0.0b for NEI item filtering (to make bug squasking easier)§r

§1§l§nVersion 4.2.4§r§1§l
§cBugfix ~ Disabled Naquada and related oreberry bushes§r
§bConfig ~ ore berry bushes are 25% rarer§r
§bConfig ~ turned off unnecessary mod types in AOBD configs§r

§cBugfix ~ turn off BoP vanilla biome overrides to prevent issues with Chromaticraft plant spawning (specifically void reeds)§r
§bConfig ~ Taint too common now (although ethereal blooms are basically free), dropped from 25 to 15.  Wake up and smell the TAINT§r

§1§l§nVersion 4.2.2§r§1§l
§cBugfix ~ Deactivated ore conversions in JWIN, GT5u is already doing this, a competing mod doing this is disruptive to controlled§r
§cBugfix ~ GT5u settings are the cause of passive mobs harming each other.  3 in a single block causes them to damage each other.  This has been increased to 5§r
§cBugfix ~ Passive WATERCREATURE type enemies have had their spawn cap lowered 10->5 (Minecraft default with normal spawning), and spawn tick rate increased 10->100.  Chunk spawning now enabled at the default rate of 0.1.§r

§1§l§nVersion 4.2.0§r§1§l (Thermonuclear Shaft Update)

§bConfig ~ One last fragment weight tweak.  Fragments are a moderately common drop now§r
§bConfig ~ Guide tweaks§r
§bConfig ~ Stupid fragments, stupid loot table, just spawn when and were I tell you to.§r
§bConfig ~ More weight for fragments!!! Custom weights and spawn counts don't seem to have an effect.  However, multiple instances of fragments can be added to the loot table to simulate higher weights.  Each instance added to the loot table will take the standard properties of a CC fragment record in that loot table (weight, min, and max)§r
§bConfig ~ Another boost to ChromatiCraft fragment spawn weight§r
§bConfig ~ Allow admins to open all guardian chests§r
§bConfig ~ Coal coke now requires a compressor to turn into blocks§r

§aAdded ~ Added zzzzzcustomconfigs§r
§bConfig ~ During some non-Agricraft testing, it was observed that using a watering can is more than 2x as effective at inducing growth ticks in Agricraft crops.  The growth tick multiplier was adjusted 1.0 -> 0.6§r

§bConfig ~ Mobius ingots are now a part of high tier HP upgrade canisters§r

§bConfig ~ Removing ElecriCraft for balance reasons (Seriously, a 60 Trillion RF capacity battery?!)§r
§bConfig ~ RotaryCraft config tweaks§r
§bConfig ~ Removed ReactorCraft-Ores.json file, it has literally no effect (sorry, no retrogen.  The built in one hangs on world load)§r
§bConfig ~ Another slight boost in info fragment weights (there are like ~250 to find, they need to be a common chest drop)§r
§bConfig ~ Added a CoFH file for TiCon cobalt to retrogen it§r
§bConfig ~ Lava is not allowed as a fuel for the smeltery.  This is a preventative action as the smeltery is still disabled at this time, but it will probably be allowed in a future update§r
§bConfig ~ Advent of Ascension updated to 2.5§r
§bConfig ~ Updated CustomNPCs and OpenSecurity§r
§bConfig ~ Removed Hearts mod and loot table entries.  Replaced with TiCon Heart Canisters§r

§1§l§nVersion 3.13.6§r§1§l
§bConfig ~ Switched GT "magic metals" vein to generate less silver and more gold§r

§cBugfix ~ Fixed the TE electrical steel recipes requiring steel plates and not the item§r
§cBugfix ~ Fixed TE pulverizer creating silicon plates and not the item§r

§1§l§nVersion 3.13.4§r§1§l
§cBugfix ~Thermal Dynamics hardened fluiduct impossible to craft to to GT unification.  It was specifically requiring Thermal Foundation invar blend.  Switched to proper oredict reference.§r
