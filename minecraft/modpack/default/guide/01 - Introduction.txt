§1§lWelcome to Ascension of the Technomancer§r

You have been exiled from your home city for your relentless persuit of "forbidden" knowledge.  It seems like the local citizenry are not big fans of your intelectual development.  In fact, the existing remainants of humanity as a whole are not really fans of higher education in technology and magic, although no one alive today really remembers why.  They just know that seeking knowledge and power bring nothing but pain and sorrow.  But why is that, and for that matter why are there so few humans to begin with?  As you explore this world alone, you will find a myriad of ruined structures dotting the landscape, and countless extra dimensional eldritch horors prowling these broken husks of a bygone era.  What has become of this world, and why?  Your alone in the wilderness now, with nothing but your wits to protect you.  At least no one will be around to disrupt your studies and experiments now.
